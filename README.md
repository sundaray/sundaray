## Hello 👋

My name is Hemanta Sundaray. I'm a full-stack web developer working with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

I'm currently building [lucidauth](https://github.com/sundaray/lucidauth), a TypeScript-first, server-side authentication library. It's the project I'm most proud of.

I'm also preparing for full-stack developer roles with a backend focus. If you have a suitable opportunity, feel free to reach out at rawgrittt@gmail.com.
